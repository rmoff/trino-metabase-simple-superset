This is a minimal setup to run Trino as a query engine with the option for query building and visualisation with either [Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) or [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/).
It includes installation of Trino support for Supersert and Metabase, neither of which ship with support for it by default.

:warning: This is 💯 intended for local sandbox experimentation. Do not even think about using it as the basis for production deployment :)**

== Pre-config

=== Trino

1. Add any catalogs that you want to in the `trino/catalog` directory.
A catalog definition is already provided for Apache Iceberg/TableFlow, and the in-memory connector.
If you are using the Tableflow connector make sure to update the `tableflow.properties` file with your TableFlow API key and secret.

=== Superset

1. Update the `superset_config.py` file with any configuration changes that you need.
.. If you want to use any map-based visualisations, you will need to set the `MAPBOX_API_KEY` variable.
Get your API key from https://www.mapbox.com/.
You do need to provide a credit card 😢 but I found that the free tier is more than enough for simple use.
YMMV of course—don't take my word for it!

== Usage

Run `docker compose up`.

=== Trino

There is a long list of Trino clients https://trino.io/ecosystem/client-application#other-client-applications[here].

Trino includes a built-in CLI.
To launch it, run:

[source,bash]
----
docker exec -it trino trino
----

This gives you a `trino>` prompt, from which you can run Trino SQL.

TIP: You can view the Trino UI for monitoring metrics at http://localhost:8080/ui/

=== Superset

Login to Superset at http://localhost:8088/login/ as `admin@localhost` / `secret`.

Create a connection to Trino:

. Go to http://localhost:8088/databaseview/list/[the Databases list] (from the Settings menu)
. Click **+ Database** button
. Under **Supported databases** select `Trino`
. Set the **SQLAlchemy URI** to `trino://trino@trino:8080/in-mem` (or use `/tableflow` if you've configured the Tableflow catalog)
+
That's a lot of `trino`s! This is what they mean:

.. `trino://` is the connection string prefix
.. `trino@` is the default username, with no password
.. `trino:8080` is the Docker container hostname (`trino`) and port on which Trino is running
. Click **Connect**

==== Exploring Superset

Under the **SQL** menu at the top click on **SQL Lab**. 
In the SQL query pane enter:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT 
    n AS id,
    'Item_' || CAST(n AS VARCHAR) AS name,
    ROUND(RAND() * 1000, 2) AS value,
    CASE MOD(n, 5) 
        WHEN 0 THEN 'Category A'
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Category B'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Category C'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Category D'
        WHEN 4 THEN 'Category E'
    END AS category,
    DATE_ADD('day', MOD(n, 365), DATE '2024-01-01') AS created_date
FROM UNNEST(sequence(1, 100)) AS t(n);
----

Click on **Run**.
You've now got some data to play around with and explore :)

=== Metabase

Metabase takes a few minutes to initalise.
Tail the container log:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose logs -f metabase-run-setup
----

Once it's ready you'll see: 

[source,bash]
----

Login to Metabase at http://localhost:3000 as `admin@example.com` / `ArthurDent42`.

Click on **Add database** on the left panel.

Create a connection: 

* Database type: `Starburst`
* Display name: _Whatever you want_
* Host: `trino`
* Port: `8080`
* Catalog: `in-mem` (or `tableflow` if you've configured it)
* Username: `trino`
